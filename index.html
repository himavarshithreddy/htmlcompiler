        <p2>Programming, or coding, is like solving a puzzle. Consider a human language, like English or French. We use these languages to turn thoughts and ideas into actions and behavior. In programming, the goal of the puzzle is exactly the same -- you're just driving different kinds of behavior, and the source of that behavior isn't a human. It's a computer.</p2>
        <p2>A programming language is our way of communicating with software. The people who use programming languages are often called programmers or developers. The things we tell software using a programming language could be to make a webpage look a certain way, or to make an object on the page move if the human user takes a certain action.</p2>
        <p2>So, when a web designer is given an end goal like "create a webpage that has this header, this font, these colors, these pictures, and an animated unicorn walking across the screen when users click on this button," the web designer's job is to take that big idea and break it apart into tiny pieces, and then translate these pieces into instructions that the computer can understand -- including putting all these instructions in the correct order or syntax.</p2>
        <p2>Every page on the web that you visit is built using a sequence of separate instructions, one after another. Your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and so on) is a big actor in translating code into something we can see on our screens and even interact with. It can be easy to forget that code without a browser is just a text file -- it's when you put that text file into a browser that the magic happens. When you open a web page, your browser fetches the HTML and other programming languages involved and interprets it.</p2>
        <p2>HTML and CSS are actually not technically programming languages; they're just page structure and style information. But before moving on to JavaScript and other true languages, you need to know the basics of HTML and CSS, as they are on the front end of every web page and application.</p2>
        <p2>In the very early 1990s, HTML was the only language available on the web. Web developers had to painstakingly code static sites, page by page. A lot's changed since then: Now there are many computer programming languages available.</p2>
        <p2>HTML is at the core of every web page, regardless the complexity of a site or number of technologies involved. It's an essential skill for any web professional. It's the starting point for anyone learning how to create content for the web. And, luckily for us, it's surprisingly easy to learn.
<br>
          <pre class="heads" >How does HTML work?</pre>
          <br>
          HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. "Markup language" means that, rather than using a programming language to perform functions, HTML uses tags to identify different types of content and the purposes they each serve to the webpage.</p2>
        <p2>Markup languages work in the same way as you just did when you labeled those content types, except they use code to do it -- specifically, they use HTML tags, also known as "elements." These tags have pretty intuitive names: Header tags, paragraph tags, image tags, and so on.</p2>
        <p2>Every web page is made up of a bunch of these HTML tags denoting each type of content on the page. Each type of content on the page is "wrapped" in, i.e. surrounded by, HTML tags.</p2>
        <p2>For example, the words you're reading right now are part of a paragraph. If I were coding this web page from scratch (instead of using the WYSIWG editor in HubSpot's CMS), I would have started this paragraph with an opening paragraph tag: <p2>. The "tag" part is denoted by open brackets, and the letter "p" tells the computer that we're opening a paragraph instead of some other type of content.</p2>
        <p2>Once a tag has been opened, all of the content that follows is assumed to be part of that tag until you "close" the tag. When the paragraph ends, I'd put a closing paragraph tag: </p2>. Notice that closing tags look exactly the same as opening tags, except there is a forward slash after the left angle bracket.</p2>
        <p2>Using HTML, you can add headings, format paragraphs, control line breaks, make lists, emphasize text, create special characters, insert images, create links, build tables, control some styling, and much more.</p2>
        <p2>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. This programming language dictates how the HTML elements of a website should actually appear on the frontend of the page.
<br>
          <pre class="heads" >HTML vs CSS</pre>
          <br>
          HTML provides the raw tools needed to structure content on a website. CSS, on the other hand, helps to style this content so it appears to the user the way it was intended to be seen. These languages are kept separate to ensure websites are built correctly before they're reformatted.</p2>
        <p2>If HTML is the drywall, CSS is the paint.
<br>
          Whereas HTML was the basic structure of your website, CSS is what gives your entire website its style. Those slick colors, interesting fonts, and background images? All thanks to CSS. This language affects the entire mood and tone of a web page, making it an incredibly powerful tool -- and an important skill for web developers to learn. It's also what allows websites to adapt to different screen sizes and device types.</p2>
        <p2>Put simply, CSS is a list of rules that can assign different properties to HTML tags, either specified to single tags, multiple tags, an entire document, or multiple documents. It exists because, as design elements like fonts and colors were developed, web designers had a lot of trouble adapting HTML to these new features.</p2>
        <p2>You see, HTML, developed back in 1990, was not really intended to show any physical formatting information. It was originally meant only to define a document's structural content, like headers versus paragraphs. HTML outgrew these new design features, and CSS was invented and released in 1996: All formatting could be removed from HTML documents and stored in separate CSS (.css) files.</p2>
        <p2>So, what exactly does CSS stand for? It stands for Cascading Style Sheets -- and "style sheet" refers to the document itself. Ever web browser has a default style sheet, so every web page out there is affected by at least one style sheet -- the default style sheet of whatever browser the web page visitor is using -- regardless whether or not the web designer applies any styles. For example, my browser's default font style is Times New Roman, size 12, so if I visited a web page where the designer didn't apply a style sheet of their own, I would see the web page in Times New Roman, size 12.</p2>
        <p2>Obviously, the vast majority of web pages I visit don't use Times New Roman, size 12 -- that's because the web designers behind those pages started out with a default style sheet that had a default font style, and then they overrode my browser's defaults with custom CSS. That's where the word "cascading" comes into play. Think about a waterfall -- as water cascades down the fall, it hits all the rocks on the way down, but only the rocks at the bottom affect where it will end up flowing. In the same way, the last defined style sheet informs my browser which instructions have precedence.</p2>
        <p2>JavaScript is a more complicated language than HTML or CSS, and it wasn't released in beta form until 1995. Nowadays, JavaScript is supported by all modern web browsers and is used on almost every site on the web for more powerful and complex functionality.
<br>
         <pre class="heads" >What is JavaScript used for?</pre>
          <br>
          JavaScript is a logic-based programming language that can be used to modify website content and make it behave in different ways in response to a user's actions. Common uses for JavaScript include confirmation boxes, calls-to-action, and adding new identities to existing information.</p2>
        <p2>In short, JavaScript is a programming language that lets web developers design interactive sites. Most of the dynamic behavior you'll see on a web page is thanks to JavaScript, which augments a browser's default controls and behaviors.</p2>
        <p2>One example of JavaScript in action is boxes that pop up on your screen. Think about the last time you entered your information into an online form and a confirmation box popped up, asking you to press "OK" or "Cancel" to proceed. That was made possible because of JavaScript -- in the code, you'd find an "if ... else ..." statement that tells the computer to do one thing if the user clicks "OK," and a different thing if the user clicks "Cancel."</p2>
        <p2>Another example of JavaScript in action is a slide-in call-to-action (CTA), like the ones we put on our blog posts, which appears on the bottom right-hand side of your screen when you scroll past the end of the sidebar.</p2>
        <p2>JavaScript is particularly useful for assigning new identities to existing website elements, according to the decisions the user makes while visiting the page. For example, let's say you're building a landing page with a form you'd like to generates leads from by capturing information about a website visitor. You might have a "string" of JavaScript dedicated to the user's first name.</p2>
        <p2>Other uses for JavaScript include security password creation, check forms, interactive games, animations, and special effects. It's also used to build mobile apps and create server-based applications. You can add JavaScript to an HTML document by adding these "scripts," or snippets of JavaScript code, into your document's header or body.</p2>
        
<br>
<pre class="heads" > For  More!</pre>
          <pre class="heads" >So there’s more than just one web language?</pre>
        <p2>There are many web languages available, however we’re just going to look at three of them. They are HTML, CSS and JavaScript and they are considered to be the backbone of the web. When it comes to web development there is front-end web development and back end-web development. These three languages are for front-end web development and are responsible for what you can see and do on a website. They are referred to as client side languages as they run in the browser (Google Chrome, Firefox etc.) of your computer. The browser translates these languages and the result of this translation is the visual web page.</p2>
        <p2>It’s important to note HTML and CSS are not considered to be programming languages. HTML is a markup language and CSS is a styling language. JavaScript, however, is a programming language. Hence, they are all web languages, but they perform different jobs.</p2>
        <p2>For those that are new to web design the easiest way to understand this relationship is to look at an analogy that will break it down into bite-size chunks. One way to look at front-end web development is to see these three languages interact with one another the same way a human body interacts with its surroundings.</p2>
        <p2><pre class="heads" >Website as a Human Body</pre><br>
          To make this easy to understand, I’m going to refer to these three web languages as different aspects of the human body. We’re going to look at the body itself as a sort of command centre; the accessories that are worn on the body as a way of representing personal style; and then the actions that the body is capable of as a way of animating ourselves. So for the purpose of this discussion, HTML will be referred to as the physical body, CSS will be the body’s accessories and JavaScript is the body’s ability to talk or move. All of these ‘bodily aspects’ need to work together to form a functional, visually appealing, interactive website.</p2>
        <p2>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) can be broken down into HyperText, which is what grants access to other texts through links, and Markup which outlines the basic structure and appearance of raw text. What this means is that HTML describes and defines the content and basic structure of the website. It does this through a means of special tags or codes which tell the browser what to do. HTML is the bare basics of a website.</p2>
        <p2>An HTML only website can be compared to a functioning human body. Note, I didn’t say fully-functional. An HTML only website has all of its body parts, although it doesn’t offer much to look at because it doesn’t have any accessories or personal style. At this stage, it’s also a body which is not capable of moving or speaking. A website which consists of only HTML</p2>
        <p2>A Cascading Style Sheet is the website’s accessories. It’s responsible for outlining the colours, font and positioning of the content on a website. It adds some style and structure to the content. In order to make use of the CSS capabilities it needs to be linked within the HTML content so that style can be added to the website. CSS will tell the browser how to display the existing HTML.</p2>
        <p2>CSS can be compared to adding personal style to the body. When you link CSS to HTML, it’s like dressing up the body. For example, you can choose a specific colour shirt and match it with a specific colour pair of trousers. On a website, you can choose the colour of the background or the font size of a heading and much more. It’s important to note that CSS cannot live without HTML as there would be nothing to style. Just like clothes or shoes would be pointless without someone to wear them.</p2>
        <p2>JavaScript controls the behaviour of the website. It’s important to note that JavaScript and Java are two different things. JavaScript was designed to manipulate web pages and it is used to create interactive functionality. Without JavaScript a website will still be functional, but in a limited way. JavaScript is what animates HTML and CSS, and it’s what brings your website to life.</p2>
        <p2>JavaScript can be compared to the body’s ability to perform actions such as walking or talking. So when you add JavaScript to HTML and CSS, it transforms the body from being a beautifully dressed mannequin into a real-life walking talking human being. It animates the body, giving it lifelike qualities. JavaScript can also be compared to a fully functional body that has the ability to interact. As we all know, having an interactive website is critical, otherwise its just a boring page filled with information.</p2>
          
          
        <pre class="heads" >It’s for Everyone</pre>
        <p2>In some countries, access to the internet has become a basic human right. So if the internet is so vital to our survival, why is it that so few of us know how to manipulate the platforms it contains? The misconception is that web development is difficult or it’s only for people who work in IT. Wrong. ANYONE can learn to develop websites. Even children are learning, at school level, to understand and implement coding languages.</p2>
        <p2>Also, web development came about in order to solve problems. Need to advertise your business online? Create a website. Need to create awareness on a specific topic? Create a website. However, every time a developer solves a problem for a client, he needs to research the problem in order to design accordingly. How time consuming! This also means an expert on the topic is not communicating directly with his audience. An IT expert is communicating on their behalf.</p2>
        <p2>Imagine a world where experts on their subject are designing platforms to solve real problems. How much more effective will these platforms be if they are designed by the experts on a specific topic and not just an expert in IT. What I’m getting at is that learning web language is for everyone. So if you’re thinking about web development, there are three important languages you need to learn. Learning how to use these three web languages is how to start front-end web development and it’s important to understand how these three languages work together. So get out there, solve a problem and create a website!</p2>
        
        <p2>The hardest part of coding is getting started -- but once you learn the basics, it'll be easier to learn more advanced programming languages. And if you ever feel overwhelmed, head over to hackertyper.net and hit random keys on your keyboard.
         <br> Trust me, you'll feel better.</p2>
